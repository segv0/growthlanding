      {
        "question": "Can I control what gets clipped and how accounts look?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. During onboarding you tell us your preferences — whether accounts should look like fan pages, which streams or upcoming streams you want us to clip from, and any specific style guidelines. We handle everything based on your direction. If something goes up that you don't like, just reach out and we'll fix it right away."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a minimum contract or can I cancel anytime?",
        "answer": "No long-term contracts. We work on a monthly basis and you can cancel at any time — no cancellation fees, no lock-in. We believe our results should keep you around, not a contract."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "Pricing depends on your stream volume, number of target platforms, and how many clips per week you want. We offer flexible plans starting from streamers just getting started to full-scale operations. Book a free discovery call and we'll recommend a plan that fits your goals and budget."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm a small streamer — is this worth it for me?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Small streamers often see the biggest percentage growth because short-form clips introduce you to audiences who'd never find your stream otherwise. You don't need a huge following to start — many of our best success stories began with under 50 average viewers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the clips actually feel like my brand?",
        "answer": "That's a priority for us. During onboarding we study your stream style, humor, and audience vibe. Our clippers are matched to creators whose content they genuinely understand. If a clip ever feels off-brand, flag it and we'll adjust — your voice is the one that matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my growth doesn't improve?",
        "answer": "We share transparent analytics so you always see exactly what's working. If results aren't where they should be, we adjust strategy — different clip styles, posting times, or platforms. And since there's no contract, if you're ever unsatisfied you can walk away. That said, most streamers see measurable growth within the first 2-4 weeks."
